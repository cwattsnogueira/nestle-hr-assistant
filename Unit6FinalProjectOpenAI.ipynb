The assistant was built using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo, LangChain’s retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, ChromaDB for vector search, and Gradio for the user interface.\n",

        "- **PDF ingestion** using `PyPDFLoader` to process Nestlé’s HR policy document  \n",
        "- **Text chunking** with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, tuned for optimal context retention  \n",
        "- **Embeddings** generated via `OpenAIEmbeddings` and stored in `ChromaDB`  \n",
        "- **Retrieval-based QA system** using LangChain’s `RetrievalQA` with GPT-3.5 Turbo  \n",
        "- **Gradio chatbot interface** with example questions and an expanded output box for readability  \n",
        "- **Fallback logic** to ensure reliable answers even when retrieval fails\n",

        "---\n",

        "##  What I Learned\n",
        "\n",
        "This project was a deep dive into the mechanics of document-based question answering. I learned how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tune chunking parameters to preserve semantic context  \n",
        "- Securely manage API keys and environment variables  \n",
        "- Build modular pipelines that separate ingestion, embedding, and generation  \n",

        "- Design user interfaces that balance clarity, usability, and conversational flow\n",

        "##  Challenges & Solutions\n",

        "- **Retrieval Misses**: Initially, the assistant failed to surface key policies (e.g. maternity leave). I resolved this by increasing chunk size and adding fallback logic with verified summaries.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Gradio Output Size**: The default output box was too small for long answers. I expanded it using `gr.Textbox(lines=10)` to improve readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **API Key Management**: I used `userdata.get()` to securely load my OpenAI key, ensuring compliance with LMS standards.\n",
